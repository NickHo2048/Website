                I envision a personal chauffeur for everyone, something that allows us to be safer and be more 
                in the moment. I think most people don't really remember their drive: how they got there or 
                even really care. I think they remember the experience: the new places they explored and the people 
                they were with. Thatâ€™s what I want to create: more moments like that. No driving. No worries. Only the moment.
